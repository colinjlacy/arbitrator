# Code Domain Emissary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/colinjlacy/code-domain-emissary.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://travis-ci.com/colinjlacy/code-domain-emissary?branch=master&service=github)

This is an NLP project that leverages the [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) library to process text into code commands.  

At this point I'm still figuring out what I'm doing, and this is not to be taken too seriously.  Once I actually have working functionality I'll update this readme.
