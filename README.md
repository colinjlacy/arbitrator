# Code Domain Emissary

This is an NLP project that leverages Cisco's [MindMeld](https://www.mindmeld.com) library to process text into code commands.  

At this point I'm still figuring out what I'm doing, and this is not to be taken too seriously.  Once I actually have working functionality I'll update this readme.

## Stopping point

This branch represents my stopping point with MindMeld.  From what I can see, there's no way to parse open-ended entities (e.g. an unknown proper name) using MindMeld.  I'll ask around, but if that is indeed the case, then it's time to move on to another library.
